				<h1>Letter from the Editor</h1>The International Journal of Computers and Their Applications is published four times a
				year (March, June, September and December), with the purpose of providing a forum for state-ofthe-
				art research and development in the theory and design of computers as well as current
				innovative activities in the applications of computers. In contrast to other journals, this journal
				encourages contributions in real world applications of emerging computer technology, as well as
				advances in theoretical areas. Current topics of interest include, but are not limited to: cyber
				security, networks, intelligent systems, parallel and distributed computing, software and
				information engineering, and computer applications (for example, medicine, business, and
				education).
				<div>
					<br>The encouragement of applied contributions implies that papers dealing with innovative
				applications of computing technology, or ones that may clarify how new theoretical results may
				be effectively used in real problems, are of interest. Theoretical papers are also welcome and are
				expected to include examples and case studies to illustrate the applicability of the theory. All papers
				are subject to a thorough peer review. The key criterion in the review process, as in other journals,
				is whether the paper contains a novel contribution to the computing area which the Editorial Board
				feels is sufficient to be of significant interest to the current/future computing research and
				application domains.
				</div>
				<div>
					<br>The editorial board includes a group of Associate Editors. The Associate Editors bring a
				substantial background and experience to the reviewing and journal development processes. An
				important goal of the editorial board is to minimize the time delay between paper submission and
				publication, without compromising the reviewing process. This is promoted through carefully
				defined reviewing procedures. We look forward to the challenge of maintaining this strategy as the
				journal activities grow.
				</div>
				<div>
					<br>Further information on the requirements/directions for paper submission, as well as
				information on past journal papers, and ordering journal copies and subscriptions is provided
				through the links to other pages.
